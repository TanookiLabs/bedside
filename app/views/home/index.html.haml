        Helping someone through a hospital stay is hard work, and it can be difficult to
        keep everyone in the know. Bedside makes it easy to publish updates to everyone in
        the group.
      %p.p-5
        Bedside also gives people a spot to leave messages and love when they aren't able
        to visit.

        Bedside lets you create a simple wishlist so that people know what to bring when
        they come to visit. That way you can suggest favorite boredom breakers or special
        treats from home, and everyone can chip in to help make the stay a bit more comfortable.
